- 👋 Hi, I’m @mcnemesis in the hackersphere, Fra. Magina in the chaosphere, and JWL C.M.R.W elsewhere.
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring, applying and creating with technology and the imagination.
- 🌱 I’m currently conducting research in computing at a fundamental level, mostly spanning interactive and intelligent systems, languages and methods.
- 💞️ I’m looking for more peers and collaborators close to what am currently researching on. Definitely, with a tip to whoever is also interested in mind-altering computing systems, platform-engineering in general, though more interested in data and knowledge engineering platforms that are ready for the near-singularity user.
- 📫 Am reachable via email - jwl[at]nuchwezi.com, or via my formal homepage: nuchwezi.com

# Fine, let's go hack reality into what we will..
